# #             OpenStreetMap Data Wrangling Project with SQL

# 
# ### Map Area: 
# I have extracted OSM file from openstreemap.org and it is for my residential area 'Milwaukee County'. Total this file is more than 2GB, hence I have reduced the area locality to get a smaller size of file which is around 150 MB. I am interested to know more about my area through this project and want to see what reveals about my locality via query.
# 
# We will now go through the data wrangling process.
